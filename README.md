# OutlierDetection-with-KNN-and-LOF
This program detects outliers in a dataset using K-nearest Neighbors and Least Outlier Factor (LOF).
KNN.py implements this algorithm using a matrix that stores all distances of data points.
KD.py implements this algorithm using a KD-tree which calculates and stores distances in O(nlogn).
